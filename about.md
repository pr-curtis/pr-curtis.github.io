I am currently a PhD Candidate in the History department of the University of Michigan. I recently completed research as a Japan Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship for the year 2015-2016 and a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellowship for 2014-2015 at The Historiographical Institute of the University of Tokyo.

My research focuses on artisans during Japan's late medieval era, particularly the late 15th and 16th centuries. I concentrate on how sixteenth-century metal casters participated in social, political, and economic relations by leveraging their value as producers of material goods. I am particularly interested in the production and circulation of forged documents between casters, courtiers, and warriors in networks of exchange.

I am also interested digital humanities and the application of network analysis to evaluate social, economic, and political relations as well as documentary production in premodern Japan .
