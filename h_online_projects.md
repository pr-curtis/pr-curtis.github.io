<p></p>I head, manage, or collaborate on a number of online projects. These include community initiatives, blogging, digital archives, and more. Below are brief summaries of each project. Click the images to the right to visit each page or external site.

<h4><em>Japan and East Asia Job Market Data Visualizations</em></h4>
<p></p>
Throughout the year I compile information and visualizations on academic-oriented job postings related to Japan and East Asia. I have compiled data for the <a href="/projects/jobs2020/">2019-2020 season</a> and the <a href="/projects/jobs2021/">2020-2021 season</a>. While I compile the 2021-2022 cycle data I have also created an open access, searchable table on <a href="/projects/jobtable2022/">current job advertisements</a> that is updated weekly.

<h4><em>Digital Humanities Japan</em></h4>
<p></p>
<em><a href="http://dhjapan.org/">Digital Humanities Japan</a></em> is an international and interdisciplinary community of scholars and professionals interested in working with digital methods, tools, and resources for Japanese Studies. We aim to foster collaboration between those with similar interests by promoting scholarly dialogue, holding workshops to develop technical skills and project ideas, and creating a central platform for the sharing of resources related to digital methods. As an organizer and collaborator, I moderate the DH Japan mailing list and digital resource wiki.

<h4><em>Digital Resources and Projects on East Asia</em></h4>
<p></p>
The <em>Digital Resources and Projects on East Asia</em> page is an experimental collaborative database that compiles digital sites on East Asia into one central spreadsheet that is sortable and searchable by a variety of categories. Powered by <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a>, the information submitted by volunteers for the table is accessible to anyone. While the table is in its early phases, only English-language sources are being compiled, such that educators and scholars can easily access the materials for developing multimodal teaching and projects.

<h4><em>What can I do with a B.A. in Japanese Studies?</em></h4>
<p></p>
I began this blog in 2010 as a second-year Master's student, begging friends to write articles about what they'd done since graduation. Finding myself continually frustrated that undergraduate and graduate students with Japanese language skills had very few resources online and in person for understanding the incredibly wide variety of career options available to them and how to navigate those paths, I decided to start compiling both the (then) scarce web resources and advice from people who had already taken those diverse paths to better help those living abroad, studying Japanese, searching for employment with their language skills outside academia, etc.
<p class="indent">Who among us has not been asked the dreaded question, <em><b>"What can you do with a B.A. in Japanese Studies?"</b></em></p>

<h4><em>Carving Community: The Landis-Hiroi Collection</em></h4>
<p></p>
<em>Carving Community</em> is a bilingual digital archive documenting the history behind a collection of <em>Edogoma</em> æ±Ÿæˆ¸ç‹¬æ¥½ (a particular style of traditional wooden spinning top), the artisan Hiroi Michiaki, and Janell Landis, an American missionary who collected his work while learning his art. This archive gathers and translates interviews by both the artist and foreign apprentice on their lives and friendship. We also exhibit the tops in the collection with video commentary by Hiroi.
