I received my B.A. in Japanese Studies with a minor in East Asian Art History from [Gettysburg College](https://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/catalog/programs/japanese.dot) in 2008, where I realized Japanese history had a hold on me and I wasn't quitting academia any time soon. I then entered the East Asian Studies Master's program at [Ohio State University](https://easc.osu.edu/degrees/eas-ma) and spent my second year of the program at the [Inter-University Center for Japanese Language Studies](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/IUC/cgi-bin/) in Yokohama. After graduating from Ohio State in 2011, I entered the [Department of History](lsa.umich.edu/history) at the University of Michigan, where I continue work on my dissertation.

I recently completed research as a [Japan Foundation](http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/) Graduate Research Fellowship for the year 2015-2016 and a [Fulbright](https://us.fulbrightonline.org/) Graduate Research Fellowship for 2014-2015 at [The Historiographical Institute of the University of Tokyo](http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-j.html).
