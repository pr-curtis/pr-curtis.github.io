I received my B.A. in Japanese Studies with a minor in East Asian Art History from <a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/catalog/programs/japanese.dot">Gettysburg College</a> in 2008, where I realized Japanese history had a hold on me and I wasn't quitting academia any time soon. I then entered the East Asian Studies Master's program at <a href="https://easc.osu.edu/degrees/eas-ma">Ohio State University</a> and spent my second year of the program at the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/IUC/cgi-bin/">Inter-University Center</a> for Japanese Language Studies in Yokohama. After graduating from Ohio State in 2011, I entered the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/history">Department of History</a> at the University of Michigan, where I continue work on my dissertation.

I recently completed research as a Japan Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship for the year 2015-2016 and a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellowship for 2014-2015 at <a href="http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index-j.html">The Historiographical Institute</a> of the University of Tokyo.
