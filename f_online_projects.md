<h4><em>● What can I do with a B.A. in Japanese Studies?</em></h4>

<p class="indent">I began this blog in 2010 as a second-year Master's student, begging friends to write articles about what they'd done since graduation. Finding myself continually frustrated that undergraduate and graduate students with Japanese language skills had very few resources online and in person for understanding the incredibly wide variety of career options available to them and how to navigate those paths, I decided to start compiling both the (then) scarce web resources and advice from people who had already taken those diverse paths to better help those living abroad, studying Japanese, searching for employment with their language skills outside academia, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Who among us has not been asked the dreaded question, *<font color="red">"What can you do with a B.A. in Japanese Studies?"</font>*</p>

<h4><em>● Carving Community: The Landis-Hiroi Collection*</em></h4>
<p class="indent"><a href="http://carvingcommunity-dentouart.com">http://carvingcommunity-dentouart.com</a></p>

<p class="indent"><em>Carving Community</em> is a bilingual digital archive documenting the history behind a collection of <em>Edogoma</em> 江戸独楽 (a particular style of traditional wooden spinning top), the artisan who created them, and his former apprentice, an American missionary who collected his work while learning his art. This archive gathers and translates interviews with both the artist, Hiroi Michiaki, and his friend and apprentice, Janell Landis, and exhibits the tops in the collection with video commentary by the artist.</p>
