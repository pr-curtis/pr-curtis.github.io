My present research traces individual and regional socioeconomic networks among metal casters, courtiers, and warriors based on the production and dissemination of documentary forgeries in the sixteenth century (Japanâ€™s late medieval period). I examine how the production of falsified imperial documents on past metal caster rights and informal metal caster histories exploited historicity to establish mutually beneficial and mutually negotiated relationships that transcended geographic, social, and temporal boundaries.

I have also been actively exploring digital methods of analyzing and representing data from my research. Below, you will find explanations and reflections on this process using various digital tools.
