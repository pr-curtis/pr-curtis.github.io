My present research traces individual and regional socioeconomic networks among metal casters, courtiers, and warriors based on the production and dissemination of documentary forgeries in the sixteenth century (Japanâ€™s late medieval period). I examine how the production of falsified imperial documents on past metal caster rights and informal metal caster histories exploited historicity to establish mutually beneficial and mutually negotiated relationships that transcended geographic, social, and temporal boundaries.

I have also been actively exploring digital methods of analyzing and representing data from my research. Below, you will find explanations and reflections on this process using various digital tools. Much has been made in recent years of how humanists can engage the digital in their work as well as whether or not the digital should play a significant role in the humanities discipline.

For those in non-Western fields, further issues present themselves, given that many digital interfaces are not designed to accommodate non-Western languages. Researchers must then contend with not only the idiosyncrasies of the tools, but also that of their source material as well, such as Asian characters, their extensive variants, and languages such as Japanese or Chinese that lack regularized word segmentation.
