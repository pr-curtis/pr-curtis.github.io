My present research traces individual and regional socioeconomic networks among metal casters, courtiers, and warriors based on the production and dissemination of documentary forgeries in the sixteenth century (Japan’s late medieval period). I examine how the production of falsified imperial documents on past metal caster rights and informal metal caster histories exploited historicity to establish mutually beneficial and mutually negotiated relationships that transcended geographic, social, and temporal boundaries.

I have also been actively exploring digital methods of analyzing and representing data from my research. Below, you will find explanations of and reflections on this process using various digital tools. Much has been made in recent years of how humanists can engage the digital in their work as well as whether or not the digital should play a significant role in the humanities discipline. For those in non-Western fields, further issues arise, since many digital interfaces are not designed to accommodate non-Western languages. Researchers must then contend with not only the idiosyncrasies of the tools, but also that of their source material and the particularities of its languages.

Initiatives examining the digital in Asian Studies are <a href="http://dhasia.org">beginning to find their footing</a>. One of the criticisms often leveled at the digital projects is that they do not necessarily produce groundbreaking or unprecedented ideas to contribute to the scholarly field. However, the benefit of these methods of analysis is often just that— the <em>methodological process</em> reveals fresh angles from which to view familiar materials and suggest previously unseen possibilities; the “humanist” in the “digital humanities” must still do what they do best: assess and interpret the results and significance. Often, digital methods end up an invisible labor that simply helped us explore our own thinking processes, interrogate our theorized conclusions, or raise new questions.
