My present research traces individual and regional socioeconomic networks among metal casters, courtiers, and warriors based on the production and dissemination of documentary forgeries in the sixteenth century (Japanâ€™s late medieval period). The formative processes underlying these networks challenge conventional scholarly interpretations of power in medieval Japan as elite-centered, vertically hierarchical, and based predominantly on cultural prestige or military power. I examine how the production of falsified imperial documents on past metal caster rights and informal metal caster histories exploited historicity to establish mutually beneficial and mutually negotiated relationships that transcended geographic, social, and temporal boundaries.
