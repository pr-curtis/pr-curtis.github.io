    My present research traces individual and regional socioeconomic networks among metal casters, courtiers, and warriors based on the production and dissemination of documentary forgeries in the sixteenth century (Japan’s late medieval period). The formative processes underlying these networks challenge conventional scholarly interpretations of power in medieval Japan as elite-centered, vertically hierarchical, and based predominantly on cultural prestige or military power. I examine how the production of falsified imperial documents on past metal caster rights and informal metal caster histories exploited historicity to establish mutually beneficial and mutually negotiated relationships that transcended geographic, social, and temporal boundaries.

Much has been made, particularly in recent years, of how humanists can engage the digital in their work. Lively debates have gone on over whether participation in digital humanities entails <a href="http://stephenramsay.us/2013/05/03/dh-one-and-two/">building your own programs</a> from the ground up or merely developing skills in the application of tools used in one’s own dataset, to what extent humanistic researchers require in-depth training in the analytical methods, theories, or algorithms underlying the technological interfaces they engage, the <a href="http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/3/000055/000055.html ">role of the digital</a> in the humanities discipline and formal publication, the utility and reception of integrating digitally-produced models and techniques into one’s research methods, and the invisible labor of producing work from materials that entertain a steep learning curve and production of tedious datasets. As with all topics of research irrespective of discipline, these debates have no clear conclusion, and there is a great deal of value in exploring arguments on both sides.

For those in non-Western fields, further issues present themselves, given that many digital interfaces are not designed to accommodate non-Western languages. Researchers must then contend with not only the idiosyncrasies of the tools, but also that of their source material as well, such as Asian characters, their extensive variants, and languages such as Japanese or Chinese that lack regularized word segmentation.
<p></p>
Initiatives examining the digital in Asian Studies are beginning to find their footing. In November, 2017, I participated in the University of Chicago’s “The Impact of the Digital on Japanese Studies,” which sought to respond to the growing question of how digital methods are currently or could potentially change the way we approach Japanese Studies research.
