<h3>East Asia-related Job Market Data Reports and Visualizations</h3>
<p></p>
Since 2019 I have been compiling information on academic-oriented job postings related to East Asia. I collect job advertisements throughout the year (summarizing the latest ads on Twitter on the weekends) and each July I present visualizations of and reflections on the data in the form of annual reports.
<p></p>  
While my data gathering is in progress, I upload the current postings in the form of open access, searchable tables that job seekers can use. These tables also include keywords by which users can filter entries as well as links to the job advertisements. The table below provides links to both annual reports and data in progress filter tables.
<p></p>
Data collection for the 2022-2023 cycle was supported by the Association for Asian Studies – National Endowment for the Humanities “<a href="https://www.asianstudies.org/grants-awards/striving-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-asian-studies-humanities-grants-for-asian-studies-scholars/">Striving for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Asian Studies</a>” Digital Humanities Grant.
