<h3>Japan and East Asia Job Market Data Visualizations</h3>
<p></p>
Throughout the year I compile information and visualizations on academic-oriented job postings related to Japan and East Asia. I have compiled data for the 2019-2020 season, for which I provide  more a general data visualization page, but I also include more in-depth examinations of trends based on <a href="/projects/PMjobs2020/">time period of specialization</a>. While I compile the 2020-2021 cycle data I have also created an open access, searchable table on current job advertisements that is updated weekly.
