My current book project, tentatively titled <em>The Casters of Kawachi: Artisans and the Production of Medieval Japan</em>, examines the history of metal caster organizations in medieval Japan (1185-1603). Using textual, material, and archaeological evidence, I uncover the history of the famed Kawachi metal casters (modern-day Osaka), whose lived and legendary histories became a touchstone for various caster groups to claim technical and social preeminence and curate strategic ties to influential patrons over the centuries. <em>The Casters of Kawachi</em> will help us to reconsider how a society viewed as largely hierarchical and dominated by the court and military elite was dependent on the material labor and social buy-in of producers who occupied crucial and fluid socioeconomic roles in society.
