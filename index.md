I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of History at the University of Michigan. I completed overseas research as a Japan Foundation Graduate Research Fellow (2015-2016) and a Fulbright Graduate Research Fellow (2014-2015) at The Historiographical Institute of the University of Tokyo.

My research focuses on documentary forgery production during Japanâ€™s late medieval period, particularly the sixteenth century. I trace individual and regional interactions among metal casters, courtiers, and warriors to determine how the creation and dissemination of counterfeit documents contributed to both the decentering and reification of imperial authority while facilitating economic bonds that transcended social, geographic, and temporal boundaries. I am also interested in digital humanities and the use of digital tools to analyze premodern historical sources.
