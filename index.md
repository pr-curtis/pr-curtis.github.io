I am a historian of premodern Japan and currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate and Lecturer in History with <a href="https://ceas.yale.edu/">The Council on East Asian Studies</a> at Yale University. My research focuses on documentary forgery production and socioeconomic networks during Japanâ€™s late medieval period, particularly the sixteenth century. I am also interested in digital humanities and the use of digital tools to analyze premodern historical sources. I manage and collaborate in several online projects, including the <a href="http://dhjapan.org/">Digital Humanities Japan</a> initiative; an online <a href="http://prcurtis.com/DH/resources">database</a> for resources related to East Asia; the blog <a href="https://shinpaideshou.wordpress.com/">What can I do with a B.A. in Japanese Studies</a>; and the digital archive <a href="https://carvingcommunity-dentouart.com/">Carving Community: The Landis-Hiroi Collection</a>.
