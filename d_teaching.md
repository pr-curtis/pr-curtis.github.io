      <p><b>Course:</b> <em>JPN 191C - Current Trends and Scholarship in Medieval Japanese History</em></p>
      <p><b>Course Type:</b> upper-division undergraduate/graduate historiography seminar</p>
      <p><b>Institution:</b> University of California, Los Angeles</p>
      <p><b>Primary Instructor:</b> Paula R. Curtis</p>
      <p><b>Course Description:</b></p>
      <p>What are the current trends in scholarship on medieval Japanese history, and whose work has guided them? This course will introduce a variety of publications from the last decade on Japan’s medieval period (roughly 12th to 16th centuries), exploring their topics, themes, and research methods as we ask why and how scholars approach their subjects through certain lenses, whether social history, gender, materiality, environment studies, or others. What are the choices writers make when crafting a research topic? How do they situate themselves in relation to foundational work in Japanese and Medieval Studies? How can a more sophisticated understanding of the present state of the field in medieval Japanese history inform our own research and analytical skills? This seminar, focused on reading, writing, discussion, and professional development, will be shaped by critical analyses of how researchers do what they do as well as applications of those lessons. Some previous knowledge of premodern Japan highly recommended. Instructor permission required.

      <p><b>Course:</b> <em>HIST 171 - The Written Word in Japan: Prehistory to 1600</em></p>
      <p><b>Course Type:</b> upper-division undergraduate/graduate lecture</p>
      <p><b>Institution:</b> University of California, Los Angeles</p>
      <p><b>Primary Instructor:</b> Paula R. Curtis</p>
      <p><b>Course Description:</b></p>
      <p>In premodern Japan, text and writing had the power to imbue swords with ritual meaning, evoke the pathos of cherry blossoms, or reveal means of salvation. People from all walks of life produced and consumed the written word in different ways, whether they hoped to shape military regimes or simply send messages to loved ones. In what ways did textuality (or, in some cases, its absence or conscious rejection) shape Japan’s social, political, economic, and religious development? What is a “text”? How does understanding its use by diverse peoples across centuries challenge our underlying assumptions about how documents, writing, and communication function in society? Surveying these issues from prehistory to 1600, this course will use writing traditions and documentary culture as a lens through which to understand Japanese history and ways of being in Japan’s premodern world. Students will use primary and secondary readings to discuss core issues in writing and textual culture, such as language, orality, transmission, translation, gender, genre, communication, and visuality. A complementary emphasis on how we, as modern readers, writers, and scholars, interpret and use written materials will provide new strategies for thinking about how history is recorded, consumed, and evaluated. No previous knowledge of Japanese/Japanese history is required for this course.</p>

      <p><b>Course:</b> <em>HIST 393: Looking for Asian Americans at UM and in Michigan: Capturing 150 years of Lived Experiences and Raw Voices</em></p>
      <p><b>Course Type:</b> undergraduate History Lab research course</p>
      <p><b>Institution:</b> University of Michigan</p>
      <p><b>Primary Instructor:</b> Hitomi Tonomura</p>
      <p><b>Teaching Assistant & Digital Consultant:</b> Paula R. Curtis</p>
      <p><b>Course Description:</b></p>
      <p>This is a project-based course that explores the two centuries of history and legacy of Asians,
      Asian-Americans and the Pacific-Islanders in the state of Michigan, especially at the University
      of Michigan. Despite the impressive presence and fascinating life stories of various AAPI
      residents in Michigan, relatively little is known. Students in this course will help to showcase
      some of their stories. The goals of this class are to discover, analyze, interpret, and represent the histories of Asians, Asian Americans and the Pacific Islanders, who made the state of Michigan their home in the last two centuries. Many were involved in the University of Michigan, as students, teachers, and administrators, while some were concentrated in urban areas and started a business, or worked in industries. Still others, the most difficult to locate, dispersed and settled in the quiet countryside without the notice of the media or the community. Students work with classmates to research in the archives, contact local organizations, interview people if appropriate, and contextualize their findings to create a meaningful narrative and visual representations in a digital format. Students will come to "own" the project outcomes as a highly relevant and meaningful experience, that can be shared with the public.

      <p><b>Course:</b> <em>HIST 195: Swords, Axes, and Spades: Writing Social Diversity into Medieval Japan</em></p>

      <p><b>Primary Instructor:</b> Paula R. Curtis</p>
      <p><b>Course Description:</b></p>
      <p>Medieval Japan has long been seen through lenses of popular culture: samurai warfare, bushidō, castles, and, more broadly, comparisons to feudal Europe and the knights that defined it. Beyond these stereotypes, however, is a far richer and more complex society than seen in most two-hour films at the box office. From the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, Japan underwent vast transformations at all levels of society, from the rapid developments in agriculture and the expansion of the warrior class to the diversification of commercial professions and the economic decline of court nobility. Society teetered uneasily on the brink of something new with each passing century, making medieval Japan much more than simply “The Age of the Warrior.” This course will examine not only the contexts that produced these changes in society, but also the historical and scholarly frameworks within which they have been examined. What about medieval Japan is, in fact, ‘medieval’? Was Japan a ‘feudal’ society like Europe and what does that mean? How do we incorporate farmers, artisans, merchants, religious figures, women, and others into narratives supposedly defined by a “world of warriors”? This course aims to turn a critical eye on our ways of understanding history by questioning our present knowledge of Japan’s medieval past.</p>

      <p><b>Course Description:</b></p>
      <p>This course offers an overview of more than three thousand years of East Asian history, from ca. 1600 BCE through ca. 1800 CE. Since every such survey must be selective, this course will emphasize political, social, and cultural transformations. Aided by the course textbook, we will inquire into the nature of political power, the succession of dynasties and military regimes, the growth and spread of religions, and the transformation of family structures, economies, and diplomatic relations. The course will introduce the different, distinct histories of China, Korea, and Japan, but will also chart the interactions between these cultures, following the travels of monks and merchants, diplomats and conquerors, across the islands and continents. The primary-source readings for the lectures, and especially for the discussion sections, will offer an opportunity to see these changing cultures and landscapes through the eyes of contemporaries: early Chinese philosophers, Korean royal officials, Japanese court ladies, even European travelers. The primary-source readings will also give occasion to reflect on the origins and nature of historical knowledge, thereby making this course not only an introduction to East Asian history, but also an introduction to history as an academic discipline.</p>

While it is open to all disciplines and areas of interest, it is recommended that participants have reading knowledge of at least one of these languages specific to their own work.

Because East Asian studies encompasses a wide range of methods, we will cover topics ranging from corpus preparation and text analysis to OCR, IIIF, network analysis, and digital resources relevant to materials in these languages. This is an introductory workshop geared toward those with little to no DH training and prioritizes applications according to experience level, the (un)availability of digital humanities specialists at their institutions, and project/teaching-oriented needs.</p>

      <p>This workshop focuses on current and emerging digital projects and methods for East Asian studies, which use primary sources written in classical and modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. While it is open to all disciplines and areas of interest, it is recommended that participants have reading knowledge of at least one of these languages specific to their own work. The workshop will include a broad overview of the state of the field, presentations of methods and hands-on sessions with tools and projects, and active discussion about pedagogy, self-directed learning, and future directions for DH research and projects in East Asian studies. Because East Asian studies encompasses a wide range of methods, we will cover topics ranging from corpus preparation and text analysis to OCR, IIIF, network analysis, and digital resources relevant to materials in these languages. This workshop is an introductory one geared toward those with little to no DH experience and prioritized applications from graduate students, postdocs, contingent faculty, and faculty developing departmental curricula.</p>

      <p>This two-part workshop will will provide an introductory overview of the field of Digital Humanities (DH). What is DH? What are some of its core methods? We will discuss the fundamentals, including a range of practices and commonly used tools. Drawing on examples from her own early experiences breaking into the digital field, Dr. Curtis will address why one might choose to integrate (or not integrate) digital humanities in their research and teaching.</p>

      <p>The workshop provides hands-on training in mapping and networking tools. The workshop couples instruction on the basic skills related to making maps and network graphs with their use in a student’s own research project. At the end of the two-day workshop, students will gain a basic literacy in how to develop a database, import these into software such as Google Maps, QGIS, Palladio, and Cytoscape and export maps and graphs to be used in a variety of publications. The presenters will explore both conceptual and practical dimensions of how mapping and network analysis can reveal new insights into East Asian religions.</p>
