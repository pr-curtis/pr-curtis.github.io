In November, 2017, I participated in the University of Chicago’s <a href="https://ceas.uchicago.edu/page/digital-humanities-workshop">“The Impact of the Digital on Japanese Studies,”</a> a workshop that sought to respond to the growing question of how digital methods are currently or could potentially change the way we approach Japanese Studies research. This page is a summary of many of the ideas that emerged from my work for this event and a guide to the process of approaching such a digital project for the first time.

My presentation, “On Forgery,” was an attempt to probe the application of digital methods to my own research and premodern Japanese research at large. I therefore took a critical and exploratory approach to determining how and if these tools were useful within my own work to map and analyze my sixteenth-century communication networks premised upon documentary exchange. In experimenting with network analysis (and mapping) tools using my documentary corpus as a basis, I discerned the drawbacks in utilizing certain digital methods with premodern documents, reaffirmed previously conclusions using more tangible evidence, and discovered new possibilities for thinking about my documentary corpus and my methods of analysis.

<h3>Sources and Goals</h3>

The Matsugike monjo 真継家文書 (Matsugi Family Documents), the basis of my research and experiments in digital methods, is set of over 6,000 documents ranging from the twelfth to nineteenth century. The medieval portion and its supplementary materials (published as Chūsei imoji shiryo中世鋳物師史料 by Nagoya University and compiled by Amino Yoshihiko in 1982) [footnote here on the database] comprises several hundred records, including aristocratic tax decrees, warlord letters negotiating access to casters, and forged histories of metal caster associations.

My research focuses on the Matsugi collection and other documentary and diaristic sources as a source of information on the networks instigated and established by the courtier Matsugi Hisanao, who spearheaded court-based forgery production and actively sought out warrior and caster collaborators to create new social and economic bonds outside of the capital. I therefore decided to create network visualizations of the person-to-person connections created by letters exchanged between the court in Kyoto and warlords in the provinces to determine whether or not digital tools could provide new insights into these communication networks.
