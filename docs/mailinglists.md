<h3>Academic Mailing Lists on East Asian Studies</h3>
<p></p>

<p></p>
For academics, mailing lists remain an important method for finding and disseminating information across the globe. Although some mailing lists in East Asian Studies have been around for three decades or more, at times they can be difficult to locate and we can miss a lot of opportunities if we lack that connection. In an effort to make some of these helpful resources easier to find, I have compiled a page of those lists commonly used by East Asian Studies scholars. This list will be updated as new information becomes available. Please <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> with any corrections.
<p></p>
If there is a mailing list you would like to add to this page, please provide information on it via <a href="https://forms.gle/491JADF8BMzQ7iik7">this Google form</a>. Mailing list descriptions in any language are welcome.
